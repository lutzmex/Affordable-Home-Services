Next, we lay the membrane and seal every seam in hot weather. This ensures a tight bond. For gutters, we size them based on your roof area and local rainfall rates. Then we mount them under the roof edge so water flows in. We use aluminum or copper that resists rust and matches your home style. Next, we run downspouts to ground level. We add splash blocks or underground drains if needed. This way rainwater never pools around your foundation or seeps into your walls."

Then we roll on the top coat. We use brushes and sprayers where needed so every corner gets covered. Our paint lines stay neat and straight around windows and siding. For fences and decks, we use stains or sealers that highlight wood grain and resist moisture. All our paints are low VOC. They are safer for your family and the environment.

Finally, we paint two coats of exterior paint in your chosen color. We respect your plants and put down drop cloths. We tape off windows so the job stays clean.

We meet with property managers to plan fencing or deck staining in the evenings or on weekends if needed. Our crew uses extension poles, scaffolding, and safety gear to reach high walls and fences by the marina. We clean, repair, prime, and paint metal, wood, and stucco surfaces with low odor, fast drying coatings. We tape and mask windows and signage carefully so your branding stays pristine. When the job is done, we remove all equipment and debris. We leave the area clear for customers. A fresh coat of paint on a harborside shop or office builds curb appeal and protects your investment."

            content: "Surface preparation and repairs before painting are often skipped but make all the difference. We test stucco for cracks, inspect siding seams, and check for wood rot or nail pops. We fill gaps with caulk, replace rotten boards, and sand uneven areas smooth. If we find water damage or mold, we treat it with the right cleaner. Then we let it dry before painting. After drying, we prime patched areas with a bonding primer so the top coat sticks evenly. This prep work takes extra time but stops peeling. It also helps your new paint look great and last much longer. We believe good prep is the secret to a job you can trust."

Let us know about irrigation lines, outdoor lighting, or special landscaping. If you have pets, keep them safe indoors or in a fenced area. We recommend covering patio furniture and grill equipment to keep them free of dust or paint. Our team respects your property and cleans up at the end of each day. We will also discuss any permit or HOA requirements with you ahead of time."
